      "Personal information has become a strategic asset—for both protection and exploitation. Zerotrace Executive was created to give clients the same level of strategic awareness about their digital exposure that they apply to every other dimension of their lives, whether they lead a company, run a household, or simply want greater privacy.",

    title: "The Executive Risk Landscape",
    content:
      "Today's privacy risks come from many directions: public records, social media, professional networks, property filings, and data-broker aggregations can collectively reveal far more than any single source. Understanding how these elements connect is the foundation of effective digital privacy—for leaders and families alike.",

  {
    title: "Our Privacy-First Approach",
    content:
      "We begin with discovery—identifying what is already publicly accessible. From there, we diagnose exposure pathways, prioritize remediation actions proportionate to actual risk, and offer ongoing monitoring for those who require continued visibility management.",

    title: "Discretion and Confidentiality",

      "Every engagement is conducted with the highest level of confidentiality. Communications, findings, and recommendations are shared only with authorized parties through secure, private channels—whether the client is an executive, a family member, or an individual.",

              Zerotrace Executive was created for anyone whose visibility, influence, or
              family connections can make personal information more valuable to bad actors.
              Our role is to help clients—executives, families, and individuals—understand
              their exposure, prioritize meaningful action, and maintain greater control
              over their digital footprint.
